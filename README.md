## About

This portfolio showcases some of the projects I've built as a **Full-Stack Developer**, using technologies like **React**, **Next.js**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **NestJS**, **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and more.

It reflects my commitment to building applications that focus on **performance**, **accessibility**, and **responsive design**, while demonstrating my ability to design clean interfaces and implement scalable backend architectures.

## Project Content

This project was structured with three core objectives:

- Present my professional and personal development work in an organized and visually appealing way
- Demonstrate my technical skills, problem-solving approach, and full-stack knowledge
- Offer an intuitive and accessible space for recruiters, collaborators, and visitors to explore my work

## Prototyping

This project was fully prototyped in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), where the visual structure, layout, and interaction flow were designed before development.  
The current version showcased here represents the **second iteration (V2)** of the design.

You can view both **V1** and **V2** of the prototype through the link below:
